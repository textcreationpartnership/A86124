            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving lately ſeen, a moſt ſcandalous Pamphlet, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by Mr. <hi>Kendall</hi> of <hi>Dept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> full of unworthy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections, which ſpeaks more malice than Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in him, though a high Pretender; I could do no leſs for my own Vindication, than take notice of it, and make a Reply, wherein I ſhall not be tedious.</p>
            <p>But before I proceed to the matter in hand, it wil be requiſite to promiſe, as a Truth, that one cauſe (though there be other ends) of Mr. <hi>Kendalls</hi> Defamation, is grounded upon ſome late Differences between us, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, upon the examination and determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the things in Controverſie, the Commiſſioners of the Navy, were pleaſed to forbid all future animoſities, and to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:117895:3"/>give a Command, that we ſhould live in peace, and love, which was no waies vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated on my part.</p>
            <p>And now, without more ado, I ſhal fall upon the Work, and anſwer to what I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive material in the Pamphlet.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As to the <hi>Naſeby,</hi> there was no cauſe at al, that what I only mentioned in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of my Book, touching her Rigging, when ſhe was but upon the Stocks, ſhould be brought in a paralel with the <hi>Reſolution,</hi> after the lengths of the <hi>Naſebyes</hi> Maſts and Yards were known, and her Riggings pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely ſet out, only it was a deſign in the Maſter of Arts, to do me a miſchief, having ſtudied the Caſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As to the <hi>Swiftſure,</hi> it may eaſily be anſwered that the Difference was great, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween her firſt built, and her laſt alteration at <hi>Woolwich</hi> in reſpect of Maſts and Yards, which muſt needs vary the property of Rig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings, therefore no leſs than malice it ſelf, could raiſe ſcruples from ſuch an occaſion, and if that Ship was joyned in the Liſt of Riggings anciently allowed her, for Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods ſake, it doth not follow that this
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:117895:3"/>muſt be a crime in me, or a ground of any loſs to the State (as is inſinuated) neither need any to doubt,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Charity prompts good men to think others are as faithful and juſt as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</hi>
               </note> who are not utterly void of Charity, but that I ſhall have ſo much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, as to conſider the Ship in the Condition ſhe is, at her coming into <hi>Chatham</hi> Harbor; and ſo likewiſe of other Ships, as I have hinted more at large, in the Epiſtle of my Book to the Commiſſioners of the Navy, and I did it purpoſely to avoid ſuch an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, as is now ſtarted by learned Mr. <hi>Kendal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this laſt Point being cleered, it will manifeſt to all, that the weight of Riggings doth not hold alike to Ships of a Rank, which might have ſpared the Concluſions drawn by Mr. <hi>Kendall</hi> moſt unworthily; for if there be no loſs in the particulars, there can be none in the general: and my ſetting of the weight of Riggings, was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for no other ends, but to make an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimate upon any ſudden occaſion: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the new Surveyor might have ſpared the labor of caſting up the Riggings for
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:117895:4"/>ſuch a purpoſe, only he loves to be med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and cares not what dirt he caſts in the face of honeſt men, to compaſſe his own deſigns: of which more hereafter.</p>
            <p>However; to cleer up mine own Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, both in the States Service, and as to private men, as to any unjuſt, ſiniſter, or unworthy dealings, thus much I propoſe to the worſt of mine Enemies (not in any boaſting way, but becauſe I am forced) and leave them free to charge me if they can, as to any of the following parcicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I challenge all the world to tax me with one diſhoneſt Action, either to the State, or to any particular perſon wilfully committed in twenty eight yeers time, ſince I came firſt into the Navy.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I am free, and willing to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt, how I have gotten that little Eſtate which I have, to any who ſhal deſire ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in that particular, and this <hi>I</hi> do the rather mention, becauſe I am envyed by ſome for my Proſperity; though it is not unknown to many, that in all my time <hi>I</hi> have deſired to live frugally, and have
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:117895:4"/>ſomtimes had the profit of other imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments (beſides the Clerk of the Surveys Place) without which <hi>I</hi> had been ſo far from adding to what <hi>I</hi> then had, that <hi>I</hi> could not have ſubſiſted, my ſelf and Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by the Sallery given me for executing that Truſt, or Myſtery (as Mr. <hi>Kendall</hi> cals it) for many yeers together.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>I</hi> appeal to all that live neer me, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>I</hi> have not been faithful to the Intereſt of this Common-wealth, in all the late times of trouble, and in particular, hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded my life, and all that was dear unto me, in the laſt Kentiſh Inſurrection, 1648. to adhere to their Intereſt, when alſo <hi>I</hi> had but few leading Examples.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>I</hi> appeal to the greateſt of my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, whether <hi>I</hi> have not attended the Duty of my place, and carried my ſelf peaceably towards all men, and yet been ſevere enough, to ſave the State what <hi>I</hi> could, whenſoever any buſineſſe came be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me touching the Survey.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>I</hi> appeal to all that know me, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>I</hi> have not been a Friend to the Godly Miniſtry, a conſtant Hearer of the Word,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:117895:5"/>a careful Inſtructer of my Family, and an Obſerver of Family Duties.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>I</hi> appeal, Whether <hi>I</hi> have at any time frequented Taverns or Ale-houſes, with all, or any of the Boat-ſwains, or Carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, of the States Ships, or have otherwiſe had open, or ſecret compliance, or corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence with them, futher, or more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intimately, than my Truſt did neceſſarily require.</p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>I</hi> do appeal to the Judgments of all that know me, whether the State hath loſt any thing conſiderable, for want of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg or experience in my Duty, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they have not reaped the benefit of my Experience, and Diligence in my Truſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond other men in the ſame Truſt in other Places.</p>
            <p n="8">8. <hi>I</hi> challenge any man that can tax me with diſſoluteneſs, nay, I can truly ſay, with one act of Drunkenneſſe, in my whol life time, bleſſed be God.</p>
            <p>Though <hi>I</hi> am not ignorant how unable Mr. <hi>Kendall</hi> himſelf, is to endure the teſt of theſe Appeals; yet, if in theſe, or any other particulars referring either to my perſonal
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:117895:5"/>behavior towards all men, or any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Truſt in the States Service, Mr. <hi>Kendall,</hi> or any other man, can juſtly tax me, as one unworthy of, or to be continued in the Truſt repoſed in me from the State (gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting me the Allowance of the ordinary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities of a man) <hi>I</hi> ſhal willingly give Mr. <hi>Kendall</hi> the Liberty of laying load upon me, without the leaſt deſire of favor, but till then, he muſt not think, that al that he ſaies of me, wil ſtick upon me becauſe ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by him, as a Maſter of Arts, which few men knew him to be before, and many men yet doubt him to be; yea, <hi>I</hi> queſtion not the Juſtice of the State ſo far, as to Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate me from his cloſe inſinuations till matter of fact be produced, and proof made thereof, in due form, and not ſuffer him by a blank—to traduce my good Name, which ſtands upon a better Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, than to be over-turned, or weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, by his undermining deſigns; not that <hi>I</hi> am ſo fond of the Service, as that <hi>I</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not freely ſubmit to the States Pleaſure in my Diſmiſſion from it, although Mr. <hi>Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall</hi> himſelf ſhould be my Succeſſor, which
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:117895:6"/>
               <hi>I</hi> eaſily perceive, and ſo may all indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Readers, is the deſign of his Book; but that which <hi>I</hi> abhor is, the Bait laid to catch it, <hi>viz.</hi> to cry up his own extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Parts and Abilities, to vilifie mine, by his Mathematical Demonſtrations, and learned Paralels, and then to render me falſe and unworthy in my Truſt, as if be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, by his Paralel, ſo much Cordage was, or might have been ſaved, of what was allowed in my Book, therefore the Boatſwains and <hi>I</hi> had ſhared it between us; Is this a Concluſion fit for a Maſter of Arts to deduce from ſuch Premiſes? The truth is, <hi>I</hi> have of late met with ſo many Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements, after all my Faithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to the State, which makes me ſo far from aſpiring the Service, that <hi>I</hi> ſhall not much regard, how ſoon I were diſcharged thereof, after a fair Vindication of thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt Aſperſions caſt upon me by Mr. <hi>Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall,</hi> who as if he kend all things knowa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the Myſtery of the Survey buſineſſe, undertakes (Dictator like) to impoſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all men his upſtart Experiences in the Navy, as if no man knew any thing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:117895:6"/>but himſelf, not at all conſidering the great Damage the State hath already ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained by his ignorance in that very thing, wherein at preſent he would be reputed ſo knowing; nor yet that the Duty of his, or my Place, is ſo much (if at all) to ſay what Cordage, either for ſize or length, is fit for this or that Ship, as to warrant the Store-keeper, to iſſue to the Boatſwains, that, and no more, both for ſize and length, without the concurrent Advice of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Attendant, whoſe Directions are, and ought to be our Voucher; for what we do to all Ships reſpectively, as ours is to the Store-keeper for the delivery thereof; nor was it my deſign in my late Book, ſo to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the ſizes and lengths of Cordage, to ſhips of each Rank, as to exclude the Maſter Attendants Judgment in varying the ſame, as the manner of built of each ſhip of the ſame Ranks, might neceſſarily require; nor yet to act without him, and his Directions, according to the ancient Form of the Office, though he ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur with me in the ſize and length, quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and quality of each ſhips Cordage. That
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:117895:7"/>which I drove at, was to let his Highneſſe the Lord Protector, and the Honorable Commiſſioners of the Admiralty, ſee the neereſt Eſtimate that <hi>I</hi> could make, of the quantity of Cordage ſpent upon each ſhip of each Rank, by ſetting down the ſize and length of each Rope; and if therein, I did either anticipate Mr. <hi>Kendals</hi> deſign for the ſame thing, or that my allowance hath been more than Mr. <hi>Kendalls</hi> Thrift thinks fit, the State is not ſo tied up to my Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that what I ſaid out of good Affection to their Service, ſhould either be like the Laws of the Medes and Perſians unaltera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or otherwiſe conſtrued any prejudice; only Mr. <hi>Kendall</hi> well hoping by this Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet, and the imaginary diſcoveries there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, to have leap't into my Place, as the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of his great, and good Service; which the better to compaſs, he would make the State beleeve, that whatſoever is, or may be ſaved by his Paralel, is purſed by me in the States wrong. Yea, I alwaies was, and ſtill am ſo far from being poſitive in my Opinion, in that, or any other particular, that <hi>I</hi> ſhall not in the leaſt grudg Mr. <hi>Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:117895:7"/>the Honor of inſtructing me better, if the State may any way reap the profit thereof, though <hi>I</hi> muſt cleerly affirm, That when both he and <hi>I</hi> have done our utmoſt endeavors for Regulation herein, it will be the wiſdom, and it muſt be the ſafety, both of him and me, to act by the old Rule of the Maſter Attendants Directions, who if he ſees cauſe to vary from our Judgments, may give more or leſſe both for length and ſize, than either my Book, or his Paralel do allow; and if he pleaſeth to cavel with them, as he hath done with me, <hi>I</hi> beleeve they are able to give an accompt of their Actions to the State, without fear of his Diſcoveries; yea, they will tell him, That whatſoever he, or <hi>I</hi> may fancy, as to the preciſe length and ſize of each particular Rope of this or that ſhip, not only may, but muſt be varied in both, in the Rigging of ſhips of the ſame Ranks, which howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he laughs at as an excuſe of theirs, in Rhyme, at the end of his Book, yet I doubt not, but if he had once obtained what he ſo greedily hunts after (my Place, or a good reward in Moneys in lieu thereof)
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:117895:8"/>he would as readily acquieſs in that Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as rational, as they that now propoſe and practiſe it; for indeed, it is not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Rig all Ships by one preciſe Rule, I mean, not all Ships of the ſame Rank, not only with reference to the various man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of their built (hinted before) but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo with reference to the putting ſhips of leſſer bulk into higher Ranks, as hath been uſual heretofore; ſo that when al is ſaid or done, that can be ſaid or done by us both, it muſt be left to the Judgment and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion of the Maſter Attendant upon the place, to make his demand longer or ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, bigger or leſſer, as the particular ſhip to be rigg'd with reſpect had to her Built, Maſts, Yards, &amp;c. may require; all which is alſo confeſſ'd by himſelf in the 11. page of his Pamphlet, to which <hi>I</hi> refer my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
            <p>For his carping at my Book, with refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to Maſts, Yards, Anchors, Cables, &amp;c. the ſame Anſwer may ſerve, that was given to the former, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters Attendant, and Maſter Shipwrights, are reſpectively to determine the number,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:117895:8"/>ſize, length, breadth, and other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, before either he at <hi>Deptford,</hi> or I at <hi>Chatham,</hi> may, or ought to warrant the Store-keeper, their delivery; and what was ſaid as to them in my Book, was more to give the Honorable the Commiſſioners of the Admiralty ſome light, or gueſs at the particulars there mentioned, than any waies to ſatisfie mine own curioſity, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe to limit thoſe Inſtruments (to whoſe Judgments I muſt, and will ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe) to my Opinion; and if Mr. <hi>Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall</hi> can prevail with them to ſubmit to his, though different from mine (provided the State may be the Gainer) I am ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; only <hi>I</hi> cannot beleeve either the one, or the other, till (if then) Mr. <hi>Kendall</hi> hath taken his Degrees in the Navy, as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually as at the Univerſity; and in the interim, <hi>I</hi> hope his Charity will invite him to ſpare my Book from the common Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of the Hang-man (a greater and more malitious revenge being rare to be found) till a better than it, be preſented by him, and allowed of by the State, wherein I doubt not thoſe in Authority for the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:117895:9"/>of the Navy, will do the State right, without any regard had to him or me, further than as both of us ſhall deſign the Service, without ambitious or envious ends of our own.</p>
